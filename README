Technologies employed
---------------------

- Programming language: http://dlang.org[D], compiler:
  http://dlang.org/download.html[DMD]

- GUI toolkit: gtk.org, the adaptation taken from
  http://gtkd.org[GtkD]

- The previous tools ara packaged for Debian-like operating systems in
  http://d-apt.sourceforge.net[d-apt].

- Configuration is done via Autotools
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html[autoconf]
  + https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/[automake])

How to configure and compile:
-----------------------------

After installing the tools you can create the configure script the
first time executing `autogen.sh`:

[source, shell]
---------
./autogen.sh [configure options]
------------

After that, `configure` is generated and executed automatically, later
you can run `configure` alone if you want.

The `configure` script currently understands the option
*`--enable-debug-mode`*.

Now you can launch the compilation with `make` or `make -jN`, where
*N* is the number of cpus or cores that your computer has, so you can
speed up your compilation. The resulting binary is located in
`./src/main/`.
